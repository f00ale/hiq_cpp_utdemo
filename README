Some examples from a seminar at HiQ Stockholm about unit-testing and mocking in C++.

Examples are using the libraries
* CrpCut - http://crpcut.sourceforge.net/
* Trompeloeil - https://github.com/rollbear/trompeloeil

You probably need to change paths to where the libraries are installed in Makefile.
